# StepMania backup
This is just a backup of my [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/) configurations and songs (you can never have too many backups).

## Notes
This is based off of the old [3.9 version](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=37892) with the [3.9 Plus Redux mod](https://sites.google.com/site/tony8642005/others/stepmania-3-9-plus-redux).

## Installation
1. Install `Installers\Stepmania-3.9.exe`. 
  * Note: It's recommended to not install in `Program Files` due to Windows UAC.
2. Extract the `Installers\StepMania-3.9_plus_redux.zip` files to the StepMania install directory.
3. See the README in the `Data`, `Songs`, and `Themes` folder for additional configurations.

## Why 3.9 Plus Redux
3.9 was the last StepMania version I've actively played (plus, there was a very long hiatus period between v3.9 and v4.0). The 3.9 Plus Redux added some features from `In the Groove` such as mines and rolls (although a little buggy). Ideally, someday I'll use the latest StepMania version and add my personal configurations back.
